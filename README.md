The project aims to build a model to classify and categorize tumors into four distinct classes. The dataset focuses on brain tumors and their classification. The four classes are as follows:

●	Glioma: Cancerous brain tumors in glial cells.

●	Meningioma: Non-cancerous tumors originating from the meninges.

●	No Tumor: Normal brain scans without detectable tumors.

●	Pituitary: Tumors affecting the pituitary gland, which can be cancerous or non-cancerous.
